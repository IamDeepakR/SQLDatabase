PL/SQL lets you define two kinds of composite data types: collection and record.

A composite data type stores values that have internal components.


You can pass entire composite variables to subprograms as parameters, and you can access internal components of composite variables individually.

In a collection, the internal components always have the same data type, and are called elements. You can access each element of a collection variable by 
its unique index,with this syntax: variable_name(index). 
To create a collection variable, you either define a collection type and then create a variable of that type or use %TYPE.

In a record, the internal components can have different data types, and are called fields. You can access each field of a record variable by its name, 
with this syntax: variable_name.field_name. 
To create a record variable, you either define a RECORD type and then create a variable of that type or use %ROWTYPE or %TYPE.
